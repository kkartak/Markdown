# Intriquing tools I've learned about in my first week

For me the biggest benefit of learning something knew, is wheather or not it can be useful.
If the skills and knowledge I've aquired can be implemented into my day-to-day job, and if so how.

Here are three things tools that I found the most enjoyable and practical:

##  Writing with Markdown

The best part of writing within the space of Markdown is how minimalist it is to navigate.
It makes writing focus less on how it looks and feels and more on the actual core of an article, report, listicle ect.,
but instead on the message and information I'm trying to convey. It not only allows me to stay more goal oriented and practical
in what I'm writing, but lets me appreciate how it's not about how an article looks, but the passion I have in writing it to begin with.
Markdown lets me do what I love doing which is writing; in adition it lets me us my computer scicene skills I learned once again in a practical way so I don't feel as if my other skills and talents are being wasted. 
It gives me a sense of acomplishment.

## The use of _underlines_ and **astrics**

I find the used of these tools allows for my writing to be quicker and more precise because I don't have to think about what I want bolded or italicised I can't simply push a simply key before and after a letter, word, or phrase and the software will do it for me.
This tool is wonderful to me because I wasn't previously aware of it and the capabilities it provided for improving my typing speed.
