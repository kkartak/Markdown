# Documenting a simple program

## Technical writers often need to create documentation that includes code samples.
These code samples can include:

- sample program output
- something you might type
- actual source code sample
- a program session
- and other things

### Different uses of list items can cause Markdown to treat them as two separate lists; this will add a space between them.
Example:
* Hi
* Bye
- Howdy
- How are you?
- Goodbye

## Technical writers use Markdown when they are *embedded* with an engineering team.
To create a new GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

1. Click the "New repository" button
2. Enter the repository name
3. Add a description (optional, but a good idea)
4. Use the checkboxes to select options
